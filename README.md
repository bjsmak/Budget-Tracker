# Budget-Tracker

## Summary

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of PWAs to operate a budget tracker. A web manifest allows the user to run the application separate from the browser while the service worker stores the user data in a cache. Data can also be stored offline and retrieved again once it goes back online.<p><p>

Packages used in this application are express, morgan, mongoose, compression, and dotenv.<p>

The interface is simple: the user is able to give the transaction a name and enter it with the dollar amount below. Depending on whether the add or subtract button is clicked it is factored into the graph on the page, showing the user's budget.
